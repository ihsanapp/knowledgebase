Search results will be shown upon completing your profile and search preferences. You do not need to update the preferences everytime as the results will be loaded based on your current preferences. However, you are free to change them in-order to widen your search.


### Results vs Hidden

The hidden tab contains everyone who you have marked as hidden after seeing their profile. Hidden results are excluded from future search results. Use the hidden feature after seeing a user profile in-order to keep your search results tidy.

### Filter USA States

When you select United States of America only in the countries option, you unlock the filter by states option. This is useful if there are too many results or you are not willing to relocate outside a state.
