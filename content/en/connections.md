Connections are what others call "matches" or "friend requests". The Connections page allows you to manage your connections. If you successfully connect with someone, the connection will appear on the Dashboard instead.

<alert type="info">
You can only have a single active connection. This is to increase overall quality and prevent ghosting and "shotgunning".
</alert>

### Accepting connections

You may notice that some "Accept connection" buttons are greyed out. This means that the other user has made their profile private or is active another connection. You cannot also accept other connections while in an active connection. Infact, your profile is automatically hidden from searched once you enter into a connection.

### Feedback

When ending a connection, you are required to leave a short feedback on why you are ending an existing connection. When declining, you don't need to.
