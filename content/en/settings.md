### Photos

Your photos are only accesible by the person you match with. Photos (even blurred) are never displayed publicly. Other users can know if you have uploaded photos on your publicly profile page. Photo links are temporary and cannot be viewed again after a certain time with the same link. Uploading abstract or unrelated photos like flowers, cats, cars e.t.c. is a violation of the terms.

### Integrations

You can receive notifications on [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) and/or [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) aside from emails and push notifications. Follow the instuructions on how to connect those services.

### Notifications

Control where you receive notifications. There is no gurantee that notifications will be 100% delivered to you hence it is best to always check your connections page regularly to see if you have received  requests.

### Verification Tier

Phone number verification is optional, however you cannot send a connection request to someone who is phone verified. They can however send a request to unverfied users.
